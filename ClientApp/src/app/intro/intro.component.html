        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p><b>Smart Amperes LLC</b> offers specialized turnkey energy control systems fine- tuned to reduce
          capacity
          and demand
          charges in the PSE&G Zone of the PJM regional transmission organization (RTO). Capacity and Demand
          Charges can
          constitute 50% or more of the electric bill.</p>
        <p>Our <b>SmartAmperes.AI</b> energy control system uses artificial intelligence to maximize electricity
          cost
          reduction.
          It observes customerâ€™s energy use pattern over time to devise optimum peak shaving thresholds.</p>

        <p>In the energy industry, peak shaving refers to leveling out peaks in electricity use by industrial
          and commercial power consumers. </p>
        <p>Power consumption peaks affect power procurement costs: In the PSEG Zone
          of the PJM
          territory electricity prices for business customers are set with reference to their maximum
          peak-load. </p>
        <p>The
          reason is simple: the grid transmission load and the necessary amount of power production need to be
          designed to accommodate these peak loads.
        </p>
