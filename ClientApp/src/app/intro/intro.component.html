      <p>Smart AmperesTM offers specialized turnkey energy control systems fine- tuned to reduce capacity and demand
        charges in the PSE&G Zone of the PJM regional transmission organization (RTO). Capacity and Demand Charges can
        constitute 50% or more of the electric bill.

        Our SmartAmperes.AI energy control system uses artificial intelligence to maximize electricity cost reduction.
        It observes customerâ€™s energy use pattern over time to devise optimum peak shaving thresholds.

        In the energy industry, peak shaving refers to leveling out peaks in electricity use by industrial and
        commercial power consumers. Power consumption peaks affect power procurement costs: In the PSEG Zone of the PJM
        territory electricity prices for business customers are set with reference to their maximum peak-load. The
        reason is simple: the grid transmission load and the necessary amount of power production need to be designed to
        accommodate these peak loads.



        Our SmartAmperes.AI reduces grid power consumption quickly and for a short period of time to avoid a spike in
        consumption by activating an on-site power generation system, or relying on a battery.
